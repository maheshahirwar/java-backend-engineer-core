# OOPS & Collections in Real Backend Projects

This module connects **theory to real backend architecture**.

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn
### OOPS
- Encapsulation as API boundary
- Abstraction using service interfaces
- Polymorphism via strategy pattern
- Why composition > inheritance

### Collections

- Lists & Sets in request pipelines
- equals() & hashCode() pitfalls

---

## 🧠 Backend Use Cases
- Payment service design
- In-memory caching
- Rate limiting
- Deduplication logic

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway
> OOPS and Collections decide whether your backend is maintainable or fragile.
