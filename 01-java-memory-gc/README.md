# Java Memory & Garbage Collection

This module explains **how Java manages memory internally** and why most backend production issues are memory-related.

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn
- JVM Memory Model (Heap, Stack, Metaspace)
- Object lifecycle in backend applications
- Minor vs Major GC
- G1 Garbage Collector (industry standard)
- Stop-the-world pauses
- Common memory leaks in microservices

---

## 🧠 Backend Use Cases
- API latency spikes after long uptime
- OutOfMemoryError in production
- Kubernetes pod restarts
- Cache-related memory leaks

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaway
> If you don’t understand JVM memory, you cannot debug backend issues confidently.
